# Orbital Laser

## Installation

For convenience, we have an install script. This will symlink the mod into the default directory that Factorio loads mods from. It requires some python packages to be installed.

```
pip install pyuac
pip install pypiwin32
```

After this, just run the following command and the mod should be placed in the correct directory and will update with any changes you make.

```
python install.py
```
